This project was created for a [Makey Makey](https://makeymakey.com) customized controller. The theme had to be trains and the inputs had to be simple enough to be controlled by everyday objects (like Bananas, pictures to come!).

It is available to play on Web, Windows and Linux on [itch.io](https://michaeljared.itch.io/train-snake).

The project is open-source, under an MIT license.

Various CC0 assets have been used (I will compile a list if I get time).
